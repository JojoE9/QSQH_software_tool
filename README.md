This is a predictive model used to generate the synthetic near-wall turbulence velocity field in all three spatial dimensions for certain Reynolds number, thereby to predict the one-point and two-point velocity statistics.

The input of the model requires the data of wall friction that is statistically representative. The output of the model will be a set of instances of the velocity field u(x,y,z) where (x,y,z) stands for stream-wise, wall-normal and span-wise directions respectively.
